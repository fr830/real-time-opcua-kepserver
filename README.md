A Simple Predix Starter Application
==========================================================
This is a small starter application for Predix beginners.
I modified it from
<https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-nodejs-starter>
and used a small cool chart library
<https://github.com/joewalnes/smoothie> to show real time chart.

### Getting Started

It's easy to use.
Just clone it to the local drive, then modify manifest.yml:

services:
  - your-uaa-service-name
  - your-ts-service-name

env:

    clientId: your-client-d
    base64ClientCredential: your-base64-credential

Then push to cloud, enjoy it :)
